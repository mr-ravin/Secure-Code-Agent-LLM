# Secure Code Agent ü§ñ [Work in Progress]

## Overview
Secure Code Agent is a **LangChain-powered** LLM based automated code review and refactoring tool that:

‚úÖ Scans for **security vulnerabilities** in source code files  
‚úÖ Supports **Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C, and C++**  
‚úÖ Refactors code to improve quality and maintainability based on detected security issues  
‚úÖ Creates a **new GitHub branch and pull request (PR)** with improvements  
‚úÖ **Optionally sends an email report** with findings and PR link  

## Features
- **Security Analysis**: Detects hardcoded credentials, weak cryptography, and insecure patterns using **Microsoft CodeBERT-Base**
- **Context-Aware Code Refactoring**: Improves structure, readability, and performance, fixing security vulnerabilities using **Gemma3:1B**
- **GitHub Integration**: Creates a new branch and submits a PR
- **Email Report**: Sends findings and PR details (if enabled)
- **Command-Line Interface**: Simple and easy to use

## Supported Languages for Code review and Security Analysis
‚úÖ Python (`.py`)
‚úÖ JavaScript (`.js`)
‚úÖ TypeScript (`.ts`)
‚úÖ Java (`.java`)
‚úÖ C (`.c`)
‚úÖ C++ (`.cpp`)

## Security Analysis
The agent detects:
- Hardcoded **AWS & Google Cloud keys**
- **GitHub secrets**
- **SSH keys**
- **Weak cryptography & insecure coding practices**

## Security-Aware Refactoring
- **Fixes detected vulnerabilities** in the code automatically
- **Uses insights from CodeBERT** to guide Gemma3:1B for smart fixes
- **Enhances code maintainability** while keeping it secure

---
## Installation
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Then, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone -b main https://github.com/mr-ravin/Secure-Code-Agent-LLM.git
cd Secure-Code-Agent-LLM

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing and running Ollama Server (ollama version is 0.6.1)
- Install Ollama Server:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```
- Ensure the LLM is present inside the Ollama Server:
```sh
ollama pull gemma3:1b
```

```sh
ollama serve &
```

---
## Usage
Run the agent with the following command:

```bash
python main.py --path <repo_path> [--receiver_email <recipient>]
```

### Arguments
- `--path <repo_path>`: **(Required)** Path to the repository to analyze
- `--repo_url`: **(Optional)** GitHub repository URL, After `git clone` it will get stored at --path location
- `--branch_name`: **(Optional)** GitHub branch where AI agent will push the code (in the same repository)
- `--do_send_email`: **(Optional)** Send an email report when set `true`
- `--receiver_email <recipient>`: **(Optional)** Email recipient for the report (required if `--do_send_email` is `true`)

### Example
```bash
python main.py --path /path/to/repo --receiver_email user@example.com
```
